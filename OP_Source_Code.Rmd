# Statement of Need

In social and behavioural sciences, longitudinal clustering is widely used for identifying groups of individual trends that correspond to certain developmental processes over time. Whilst popular clustering techniques, such as k-means, are suited for identifying spherical clusters [@GenoFali:2010; @Curman:2015], there has been little attempt to modify such methods to identify alternative forms of cluster, such as those that represent linear growth over time (i.e. directionally-homogeneous clusters). To address this shortcoming, we introduce `Anchored k-medoids`, a package referred to as `Ak-medoids`, which implements a medoid-based expectation maximisation (MEM) procedure within a classical k-means clustering framework.  The package includes functions to assist in the manipulation of longitudinal data sets prior to the clustering procedure, and the visualisation of solutions post-procedure. The potential application areas of `Ak-medoids` include criminology, transport, epidemiology and brain imaging.
