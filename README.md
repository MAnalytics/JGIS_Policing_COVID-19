The empirical work outlined here can be conducted, using the R source code: [`OP_Source_Code.Rmd`](./OP_Source_Code.Rmd)

Due to the `Twitter's Developer Agreement and Policy`, we will not be able to share any datasets, but we are confident that the source codes should run smoothtly if a user download the Twitter datasets following our instructions and recommended [`OP_Source_Code.Rmd`](./OP_Source_Code.Rmd). All the user-defined functions used by [`OP_Source_Code.Rmd`](./OP_Source_Code.Rmd)` can be found [here](./funct/functions.R)
