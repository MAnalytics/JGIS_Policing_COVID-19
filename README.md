The empirical work outlined here can be conducted, using the R source code: `OP_Source_Code.Rmd`

Due to the ***Twitter's Developer Agreement and Policy***, we will not be able to share any datasets, but we are confident that the source codes should run smoothtly if a user download the Twitter dataset using the R packages and procedures that we recommended in the `OP_Source_Code.Rmd` document.
